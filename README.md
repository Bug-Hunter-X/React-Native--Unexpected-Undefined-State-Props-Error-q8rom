This repository demonstrates a common React Native bug: attempting to access state or props before they've been properly initialized. The `bug.js` file shows the erroneous code, leading to an undefined error. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected approach using optional chaining or conditional rendering to handle cases where the state or props might be undefined initially.  This is often caused by asynchronous operations where data fetching hasn't completed before rendering. The solution ensures a smoother user experience by gracefully handling potential undefined values.
